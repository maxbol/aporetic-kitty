Custom build of Aporetic (https://github.com/protesilaos/aporetic), formerly known as Iosevka Comfy, that includes stuff in the build plan that makes ligatures compatible with the Kitty terminal emulator.

I am not a rights holder to anything. The build plan is copied from the repo above and the base font (Iosevka) is licensed under OFL-1.1. It can be found here:
